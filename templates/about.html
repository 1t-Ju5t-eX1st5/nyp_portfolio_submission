                    <p class="about-desc">
                            I first learnt to code in Primary 3, when my Co-curricular Activity (CCA) teacher taught us
                            how to use Scratch to develop a simple game. After that session, I developed an interest for
                            computer science and programming, and wanted to keep improving my ability to code in order to 
                            develop better programs that can help others.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-desc">
                            In Secondary 2, I participated in the Youth Cyber Exploration Programme (YCEP) that the Cyber Security Agency
                            of Singapore (CSA) hosts annually. This competition provided me with an entirely new perspective on cybersecurity,
                            offering a glimpse into the world of hacking and the exhilaration that accompanies engaging in CTF challenges. 
                            It was also through this event that led me to meet my current group of friends (Yes But No - YBN)

                            My first coding project began as an inside joke within my friend group, which I eventually 
                            decided to turn this into an actual bot after having been inspired by Discord bots such
                            as Dyno and MEE6, and wanted to learn to develop my own.
                            <br><br>
                            It was a challenging process, and I ended up relying on the help of some of my older friends, whom were much more versed
                            than I was in programming at the time. Eventually, I managed to get a working prototype running after a few months of trial-and-error
                            , and shared with with the rest of YBN.

                            The first CTF that I won a prize in was the Advanced Youth Cyber Exploration Programme (AYCEP) in 2021. Teaming up with several older
                            students, we managed to win the Team CTF about incident response, and got us featured on the Straits Times article about the CTF. 
                            Although I was unable to contribute a significant amount to the team, I managed to learn a great deal about incident response, and the 
                            steps that should be taken during incident response. 
                            <br><br>
                            This was also where I won my hoodie, which I continued to wear up until now, in various settings such as in school, in public and in
                            various other competitions such as YCEP 2022 and 2023.
