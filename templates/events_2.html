          <p class="port-desc">This was the second Capture-the-Flag competition that I have participated in, and I was fortunate
            to have been paired up with experienced teammates. Through them, I learnt a great deal about incident response, such 
            as how it is conducted, and what we can do to prevent data breaches from occuring in the first place.

          <p class="port-desc">This was my first physical Capture-the-Flag competition (due to the COVID-19 pandemic), and I had teamed up with several
            friends from the School of Science and Technology (SST). Although we only won the 2nd runner-up prize, I still found
            the CTF challenge an enjoyable and fruitful event, as I got to improve my skills at web hacking and cryptography

          <p class="port-desc">I was offered the opportunity to participate in my Secondary school's Open House event,
            representing the school's Computing booth. Through this event, I not only got to bond with several other Computing
            and CPA students, but also got to experience the process of preparing for an open house, as well as learning how
            to present my projects effectively to parents<br>

            <p class="port-desc">
                I participated in Ngee Ann Polytechnic's Hack'n'Flag (HNF) 2023 with my friends, and finally managed to achieve the first place for
                the team CTF on the third day of YCEP. Through HNF2023, I also got to put what I had learnt during YCEP 2022 to practice, and even
                got to pick up new skills such as OSINT (Open Source INTelligence) from my teammates. This year, I also got the opportunity to participate
                in the Central Capture-the-Flag competition!
