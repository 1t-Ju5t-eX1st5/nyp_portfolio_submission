            Oh hello there, I was expecting you. I've hidden a couple of flags within my website, let's see if you

            Fun fact: You may have noticed that I seem to be wearing a hoodie in many of the pictures that I appear in. It was a prize given out by 
            CSA for everyone who was chosen to go to A.YCEP 2021, and I was one of them!
